Simply put this is a pizza cost calculator. It can use floats for half toppings and asks what toppings you want with the assumption that if in actual use someone would count the toppings you give and input a number. You as the user should input a number, either as a whole or a x.5 number. It determines distance by inputing the nearest whole number for mileage. Anything over 30 returns that the delivery is too far and cancels the order. Anything with 0 miles returns as a pickup only with, prompting a different pick up cost.

Follow the prompts to enter: large or small number of toppings distance of delivery (0 for pickup)

It should return (and has returned for my testing) a string showing you your inputs and the final cost.
